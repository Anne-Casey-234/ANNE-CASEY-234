 SELF ASSESSMENT:
 When I started this program, my initial goal was to create a mobile app. My career goal has 
changed since. I would like to start off simply in a career where I can continue to improve my 
coding skills. I am not sure where I want to start. I truly have not looked very in depth as to 
what my options are locally. 

While in this program I learned a lot about my skills, and I realized I thrived mostly in any 
security classes I took. I had a natural knack for secure coding classes or any network 
security class. I look forward to pursuing a future career in that department. I was pleasantly 
surprised about the changes that occurred during my time here. This program certainly helped me 
grow and helped me discover at what I am good. I will continue to work on my projects that I 
have been added to this repository. My way of looking at projects has changed since going 
through this program. I used to see it as a singular time spent on it. Once it is done, I move on, 
but that is no longer the case. I learned that these projects can be an evolving process that you 
can keep learning from. I look forward to the future and increasing my knowledge every day. 


Enhancement: Software Design and Engineering.

 For this Enhancement I have taken code from my Computational Graphics and Visualization. 
The code I will be enhancing was from my module 6 assignment called tutorial 6-3. I chose this 
scene to highlight software design and engineering because lighting can enhance the depth and 
realism of the scene by creating shadows, highlights, and reflections that mimic real-world 
lighting conditions. It can help define the shapes of objects, create mood and atmosphere, and 
draw the viewer‚Äôs eye to certain areas of the scene. By adjusting the intensity, color, and 
direction of lights, you can control the visual impact and overall aesthetics of the 3D model. It is 
like painting with light to bring your scene to life and make it more visually appealing and 
engaging. 

In a 3D design you can adjust the lighting components by manipulating the ambient, diffuse, and 
specular properties. For example, in C++, you can set the ambient, diffuse, and specular values 
for a material and light source, then calculate the lighting at each pixel on the object‚Äôs surface. 
Using Ambient, diffuse, and specular values in coding showcases skills by demonstrating my 
understanding of how light interacts with the surfaces in a 3D environment. By manipulating 
these values effectively, you can create a realistic lighting effect that enhance the visual quality 
of your 3D models. It shows that you have a strong grasp of computer graphics concepts and the 
ability to implement complex algorithms to achieve desired visual outcomes. Mastering the 
manipulation of these values can elevate the overall look and feel of your 3D scenes creating a 
visually stunning and immersive environment.
   
   While working on this enhancement I learned a lot about my current skills and reflected on how 
far I have come and how much more I can learn. I have come to understand that being a 
developer is an ever-evolving career and I look forward to my continued understanding of the 
area.
