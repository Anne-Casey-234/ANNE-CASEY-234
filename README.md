 SELF ASSESSMENT:
 When I started this program, my initial goal was to create a mobile app. My career goal has 
changed since. I would like to start off simply in a career where I can continue to improve my 
coding skills. I am not sure where I want to start. I truly have not looked very in depth as to 
what my options are locally. 

While in this program I learned a lot about my skills, and I realized I thrived mostly in any 
security classes I took. I had a natural knack for secure coding classes or any network 
security class. I look forward to pursuing a future career in that department. I was pleasantly 
surprised about the changes that occurred during my time here. This program certainly helped me 
grow and helped me discover at what I am good. I will continue to work on my projects that I 
have been added to this repository. My way of looking at projects has changed since going 
through this program. I used to see it as a singular time spent on it. Once it is done, I move on, 
but that is no longer the case. I learned that these projects can be an evolving process that you 
can keep learning from. I look forward to the future and increasing my knowledge every day.
